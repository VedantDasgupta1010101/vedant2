            A hobby is considered to be a regular activity that is done for enjoyment,
             typically during one's leisure time. Hobbies include collecting themed items and objects,
              engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements.

            There are many hobbies in the world such as rock collecting,
             stamp collectiong, musical hobbies and so on.
              But my hobbies are different than others or should I say Uncommon hobbies.

        <h3>
            My favourite Hobby is element collecting. Yes I know that it 
            sounds weird that how can you collect elements! but it is possible!
            By now I have around many elements collected.
            Some of them are Cu or copper, Ru or Ruthenium, Rh or Rhodium, Pd or Palladium and my personal favourite 
            Os or Osmium! It is a hobby I am soon going to complete!
